Data Classes and Configuration

This module provides data classes for configuring and capturing results from
statistical property tests in probability theory. It contains configuration
parameters and structured result containers for empirical verification of
mathematical properties like linearity, additivity, variance scaling, and
transformations of random variables.

The classes facilitate:
- Test configuration with customizable sample sizes and tolerance thresholds
- Structured result objects for different statistical property tests
- Statistical analysis with confidence intervals and error measurements
- Interpretation of test results based on configurable quality thresholds

These components support the statistical verification framework that empirically
validates theoretical mathematical properties through sampling and analysis.
