# Recursion vs. Iteration

Recursion and iteration (using loops) are both ways to repeatedly execute a set of instructions. 
While iteration uses a loop construct, recursion achieves repetition through repeated function calls. Every problem that can be solved with recursion can also be solved with iteration, and vice-versa. 

The choice between the two often depends on 
- the nature of the problem
- the clarity of the solution
- performance considerations.
