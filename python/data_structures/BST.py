    Build a balanced binary search tree from a sorted array using divide-and-conquer recursion.
    This algorithm creates a height-balanced BST by recursively selecting the middle element
    as the root and building left and right subtrees from the remaining elements. The resulting
    tree maintains optimal search performance with O(log n) height.

    Uses dictionary literals for node creation instead of procedural construction
    (e.g., creating empty dict and setting keys separately), which is more concise
    and expresses the tree structure declaratively.

    Time Complexity: O(n) - each element is processed exactly once
    Space Complexity: O(log n) - recursion depth for a balanced tree, plus O(n) for the tree structure

"""
I felt like this was an interesting case, because iteration and recursion represent different approaches
to finding the depth of a binary search trees, moreso than other iteration and recursion problems.

Comparison of Iterative (BFS) vs. Recursive (DFS) Tree Traversal Approaches

Both functions find the depth of a binary search tree but use fundamentally different traversal strategies:

Iterative Approach (find_depth_iterative):
    - Implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal using a queue
    - Processes the tree level-by-level (horizontally)
    - Uses a queue data structure (FIFO) to track nodes to visit
    - Time Complexity: O(n) - each node is processed once
    - Space Complexity: O(w) - where w is the maximum width of the tree
    - Avoids call stack limitations for very deep trees
    - Most efficient for wide, shallow trees

Recursive Approach (find_depth_recursive):
    - Implements Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal using recursion
    - Explores branches completely before backtracking (vertically)
    - Uses the call stack to implicitly track the traversal path
    - Time Complexity: O(n) - each node is processed once
    - Space Complexity: O(h) - where h is the height of the tree (recursion stack)
    - Can hit stack overflow for very deep trees
    - Most efficient for deep, narrow trees

Memory Usage Patterns:
    - In balanced trees (height â‰ˆ log n): Both use O(log n) space
    - In skewed trees: Recursive DFS may use O(n) space
    - In wide, shallow trees: Iterative BFS may use more space than DFS

The choice between these approaches depends on the tree structure and specific application requirements.
